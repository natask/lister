WRAPPED-L is a wrapped list as returned by `lister--wrap-list'.

A 'wrapped' list consists of pairs of CAR and CDR, where each car
contains the list item, and the cdr an associated sublist (or
nil).

FN has to reorder the elements of WRAPPED-L according to the car
of each element, but to leave the wrapped pairs themselves
untouched.  For a function that normally uses predicates on plain
lists, such as sorting functions, this can be done by filtering
the predicate argument with `car'.  Functions that work on plain
lists without inspecting their contents, such as `reverse', work
out of the box.
